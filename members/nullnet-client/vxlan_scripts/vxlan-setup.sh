# never does, every time (a hard, reproducible ceiling, not a fragmentation
# reliability issue). That's ~400 bytes tighter than a naive 1500 - VXLAN(50)
# - ESP(~35) estimate accounts for, which means something in this specific
# underlay path (likely the Proxmox host network's own overlay/SDN layer)
# adds overhead this VM's own `ens18` MTU doesn't reflect. Rather than keep
# guessing at a theoretical budget, 1080 just stays safely under the measured
# 1104-byte ceiling. Set on every interface in the chain so the path is
# uniformly sized and the kernel advertises a correct TCP MSS / fragments UDP
# at the right boundary. Same-host (MACsec veth) tunnels don't need this — no
# physical MTU applies to a local veth pair — but sharing one constant is
