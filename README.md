# nullnet

Nullnet is a gRPC-based control plane that lets clients on different hosts expose services
to each other on-demand, building the required network infrastructure (VLAN / VXLAN) only
when a service is actually requested and tearing it down when it is no longer needed.

This repository is a Cargo workspace holding the three binaries that make up the architecture
plus the shared gRPC interface.

```

## Prerequisites

- install Rust
  ```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

The repository should be cloned under `/root` so the provided `setup-*.sh` scripts and
`.service` units work without changes.

## Usage

### nullnet-server

- set environment variables (in `members/nullnet-server/.env`)
  ```
  NET_TYPE=VXLAN
  CERT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32 raw bytes or 64 hex chars>
  PROXY_IP=192.168.1.100
  ```
  `CERT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is **required** — the server refuses to start without it. It encrypts
  TLS certificate private keys (and the DNS-provider credentials of ACME-issued certs) at rest;
  keep it stable, since rotating it makes existing encrypted data undecryptable. Generate one with
  `openssl rand -hex 32`.

  `PROXY_IP` is the IP of the host running `nullnet-proxy` (the egress gateway). It is **required to
  enable egress brokering**: when a registered service reaches out to the internet the server builds
  a per-initiator egress edge to this host. If unset, egress is disabled (the trigger is rejected
  with "PROXY_IP is not configured") — ingress still works.

- TLS certificates are issued from Let's Encrypt via a DNS-01 challenge (UI: *Certificates* page).
  Each cert stores its DNS-provider credentials encrypted at rest and is **renewed automatically**
  before expiry. The renewal scan is tunable via optional env vars (defaults shown):
  ```
  CERT_RENEWAL_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=43200   # how often to scan (12h)
  CERT_RENEWAL_DAYS_BEFORE=30              # renew when expiring within N days
  CERT_RENEWAL_DNS_PROPAGATION_SECS=30     # wait after writing the TXT record
  ```

- service configuration is split per **stack** — one TOML file per stack under
  `members/nullnet-server/services/`. The filename (minus `.toml`) is the stack name.
  For example, to define a stack called `my-app`, create `services/my-app.toml`:
  ```
  [[services]]
  name = "color.com"
  timeout = 0
  proxy_dependencies = [["fs.color.com"]]

  [[services.triggers]]
  port = 5555
  chain = ["ts.color.com"]

  [[services]]
  name = "fs.color.com"
  ...
  ```

- `timeout` controls proxy-reachability: when present the service is a proxy-reachable entry point
  with that per-client idle timeout in seconds (`0` disables the timeout); omit it to keep the
  service off the proxy (backend-only)
- `proxy_dependencies` is a list of independent dep chains walked when the service is reached via a
  `Proxy` RPC from nullnet-proxy; each inner array is one linear branch and all branches are brought
  up in parallel
- each `[[services.triggers]]` block pairs a port observed on the initiator's host with a linear
  chain walked when the service is reached via a `BackendTrigger` RPC from nullnet-client (one
  chain per port)
- service names are unique within a stack; dependency chains stay intra-stack. Service names may
  be reused across different stacks

- run the project as a daemon (from the repo root)
  ```
  ./setup-server.sh
  ```

- the server regularly renders one Graphviz file per stack under
  `members/nullnet-server/graphs/<stack>.dot`

***

### nullnet-proxy

- set environment variables (in `members/nullnet-proxy/.env`; set `CONTROL_SERVICE_ADDR` to the IP
  of `nullnet-server`)
  ```
  CONTROL_SERVICE_ADDR=192.168.1.100
  CONTROL_SERVICE_PORT=50051
  ```

- run the project as a daemon (from the repo root)
  ```
  ./setup-proxy.sh
  ```

- the proxy listens on port 80 (requests in the form `service_name:80`) and, for hosts that have a
  TLS certificate, on port 443 — HTTP requests to those hosts get a 301 redirect to HTTPS

***

### nullnet-client

- set environment variables (in `members/nullnet-client/.env`; set `CONTROL_SERVICE_ADDR` to the IP
  of `nullnet-server`). The uplink interface is auto-detected from the host's default route.
  ```
  CONTROL_SERVICE_ADDR=192.168.1.100
  CONTROL_SERVICE_PORT=50051
  INGRESS_ALLOW_PORTS=22,8080
  EGRESS_GATEWAY=true          # only on the host that runs nullnet-proxy
  ```

  > **⚠️ The client attaches a default-deny eBPF firewall to the uplink NIC on startup.** By default
  > it permits only the nullnet control plane (gRPC to the server) and data plane (VXLAN to peers),
  > plus established returns. **Set `INGRESS_ALLOW_PORTS` to include `22`** (and any other inbound TCP
  > listeners such as `8080` for the dashboard) or you will lose SSH the moment the client starts —
  > enabling it over an SSH session with `22` missing kills the session. Ports are inbound TCP only.

  `EGRESS_GATEWAY=true` is set **only on the gateway host** (the one running `nullnet-proxy`). It
  switches that node's firewall to gateway posture — all outbound is allowed (and tracked) and it
  forwards brokered egress to the internet, plus the implicit inbound `80`/`443`. Every other
  (strict) node keeps outbound restricted to the control/data plane. Note: a strict node's *own*
  host traffic (DNS, DHCP renewal, NTP, non-nullnet outbound) is dropped — pin a static IP and be
  aware SSH survives only via `INGRESS_ALLOW_PORTS` + established-return tracking.

- service configuration must be stored at `members/nullnet-client/services.toml`. Each entry
  must declare its `stack` (which must match a `services/<stack>.toml` on the server, otherwise
  the declaration is dropped):
  ```
  # services = [] # use this if you don't want to declare any service

  [[services]]
  name = "color.com"
  port = 3001
  docker_container = "stack-name_container-name" # should correspond to the label "com.docker.swarm.service.name"
  stack = "my-app"

  [[services]]
  ...
  ```

- run the project as a daemon (from the repo root)
  ```
  ./setup-client.sh
  ```
